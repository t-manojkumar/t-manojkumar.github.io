# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a clean, minimalist, and interactive single-page site designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. It's built with a focus on a great user experience, with a few fun surprises hidden inside.

    * A text glitch effect on project titles
    * A hidden Tic-Tac-Toe game
    * A live weather widget that shows the visitor's local forecast
